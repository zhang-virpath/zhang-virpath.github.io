I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Bernard Moss at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, where I investigate the molecular biology, structural organization, and host-pathogen interactions of vaccinia virus, a model system for studying poxviruses and cytoplasmic DNA virus replication. My work continues a long-standing legacy in the Moss lab, which has made seminal contributions to the fields of viral gene expression, immune evasion, membrane fusion, and viral vector development.

My research is focused on elucidating how large, complex DNA viruses such as vaccinia orchestrate key steps in the infection cycle—entry, uncoating, genome replication, and transcription—without access to the host cell nucleus. A central aspect of this work involves dissecting the entry-fusion complex (EFC), a multi-subunit viral machinery essential for mediating membrane fusion and delivering the viral core into the cytoplasm. By integrating biochemical labeling, mass spectrometry, protease protection assays, and AlphaFold-based structural modeling, I aim to map the accessibility and dynamic rearrangement of EFC components, providing insight into the conformational changes that underlie fusion triggering.

In parallel, I am exploring the roles of viral structural proteins in virion assembly, with particular interest in how protein-protein interactions and conformational transitions contribute to the formation of infectious particles. This work seeks to define key checkpoints in virus morphogenesis and their vulnerability to therapeutic disruption.

Beyond entry and assembly, I also study post-translational modifications that regulate the function and fate of viral proteins. My recent work identified O-GlcNAcylation on vaccinia proteins during infection—an underexplored regulatory layer in poxvirus biology. Using click chemistry-based labeling combined with mass spectrometry, I am characterizing these modifications to uncover their roles in host-pathogen interactions, protein stability, and immune modulation.

More broadly, my research interests encompass several areas of virology, including:

* Viral immune evasion mechanisms that subvert host innate sensing and cytokine signaling pathways.

* Virus-host protein interaction networks that reprogram cellular functions to facilitate viral replication.

* Viral genome evolution, with a focus on gene duplication, modularity, and host adaptation strategies in large DNA viruses.

* Rational design of viral vectors for vaccine development and therapeutic gene delivery, guided by mechanistic insights into replication and gene regulation.

By combining classical virological methods with modern omics, structural prediction, chemical biology tools and systems-level approaches, I aim to uncover the principles governing virus-host interactions and identify actionable targets for antiviral development and immunotherapeutic innovation.
