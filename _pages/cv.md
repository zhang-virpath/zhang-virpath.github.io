Education
======
* Ph.D in University of Maryland
* M.S. in Indiana University Bloomington


Research experience
======
* 2024 - presend: Postdoctoral fellow @ National Institutes of Health, MD, USA
  * Mechanisms of viral entry and membrane fusion: Dissects the structure and function of the vaccinia virus Entry-Fusion Complex (EFC), using biochemical labeling, protease protection assays, mass spectrometry, and AlphaFold modeling to understand conformational dynamics during viral fusion and core delivery.
  * Viral immune evasion and host modulation: Studies how vaccinia virus proteins counteract host innate immune sensing and cytokine signaling pathways, contributing to understanding of viral strategies to subvert immune responses.
* Virus‚ÄìHost protein interaction networks: Maps interactions between viral and host proteins to uncover mechanisms of cellular reprogramming that support viral replication and pathogenesis.

* 2019 - 2024: Predoctoral Fellow @ National Institutes of Health, MD, USA ; PhD student/candidate @ University of Maryland, MD, USA
  * Virion assembly and morphogenesis: Investigates how viral structural proteins mediate assembly and shape transitions of infectious particles, focusing on protein-protein interactions and identifying critical checkpoints in virus morphogenesis.
  * Post-Translational modifications of viral proteins: Explores how modifications such as O-GlcNAcylation regulate viral protein function, stability, and immune evasion, applying click chemistry and mass spectrometry to define roles in infection.
  * Virus‚ÄìHost protein interaction networks: Maps interactions between viral and host proteins to uncover mechanisms of cellular reprogramming that support viral replication and pathogenesis.

* 2017-2019: Research Assistant @ Institute for Immunology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China
  * Immune signaling and autoimmune disease mechanisms: Investigates immune signaling pathways, particularly those involving macrophage activation, myeloid cell dysfunction, and their role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
  * Therapeutic target identification: Contributed to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies by investigating immune dysregulation in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19.
  * Functional analysis of CD127‚Å∫ monocytes: Identified a subset of CD127-positive human monocytes through single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Demonstrated their IL-7 responsiveness and STAT5-mediated anti-inflammatory transcriptional programs, revealing previously unrecognized monocyte heterogeneity in chronic inflammation.

* 2013-2017: Research Assistant @ Antibiotics Resistance Laboratory, Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana, USA
  *	Identify mechanisms for resistance to multiple antibiotic classes in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) clinical isolates.
  *	Establish a new paradigm for sustainable antibiotic drug discovery in an academic setting
  *	Optimize antibiotic properties of current chemical compounds with antibacterial activity and evaluate lead compound status.
